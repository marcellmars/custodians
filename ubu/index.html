<h1>Happy birthday, <a href="http://ubu.com">Ubu.com</a>!</h1>
<p>Dear fellow custodian,</p>
<p>Ubu.com turns 20 this year. For about the same time the Internet has been a mass medium on a global scale and we, personally, have been using it on a daily basis. This is a perfect occasion for a gift, to Ubu, to the Internet and to ourself: two mirrors, one at <a href="https://ubu.memoryoftheworld.org">ubu.memoryoftheworld.org</a> and one at <a href="http://ubu-mirror.ch">ubu-mirror.ch</a>.</p>

<p>For all accounts and purposes, something like Ubu should not exist. A single person, Kenneth Goldsmith, using no money what so ever, has created the single-most important archive of avant-garde and outsider art on the Internet. Works that have played an important role in cultural history, or could play in the future, have been selected, organized and made available to anyone, with no restrictions, just the friendly reminder to respect the works.</p>

<p>In a world of money-crazed start-up, surveillance capitalism, copyright madness and abuse, Ubu represents an island of culture. It shows what a single person, with dedication and focus, can achieve.</p>

<p>Ubu thaught us:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, keep it simple and avoid constant updates. Ubu is plain html, written with a text-editor.</li>
<li>Second, even a website should function offline. One should be able to take the hard disk and run. Avoid the cloud - computers of people you don't know and who don't care about you.</li>
<li>Third, don't ask for permissions. You would wait forever to get them and turn into an accountant and lawyer in the meantime.</li>
<li>Fourth, don't promise anything. Do it the way you like it.</li>
<li>Fifth, you don't need search engines to be found. Rely on word-of-mouth and direct links for an organic developement of a public. At same way, you don't need complicated protocols of any kind, digital currencies or other proxies. You need people who care.
<li>Sixth, everything is temporary, even after 20 years. Servers crash, disks are dying, life changes and shit happens. Care and redundancy is the only path to longevity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is why we decided to run mirrors. Because we care and because we want this resource to exist. The first four points are why we could do it fairly easily.</p>

<p>Ubu is now located in the US, Mexico, Island and Switzerland. The Island mirror is part of cultural activist community, the Swiss mirror is run by a major art school. None of this matters, as long as <a href="http://ubu.com">Ubu.com</a> runs fine. But dependening on what shit might happen, this multiplicity of locations and in institutions might come in handy. We will see.</p>

<p>Find your Ubu. It's time to mirror each other in solidarity.</p>
